    "## 02 Before You Start\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter intends to provide an overview of `Osprey` requirements,\n",
    "installation guidelines, and helpful suggestions for organizing MRS data in a\n",
    "meaningful folder structure. The efficient use of `Osprey` requires some very\n",
    "basic familiarity with MATLAB. If you have never used MATLAB before, someone\n",
    "else in your group probably has, and can assist with setting everything up for\n",
    "you to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need the following software and code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MATLAB** (version 2017a or newer) with the *Optimization Toolbox* and the\n",
    "  *Statistics Toolbox*. You may need to ask your institutional system\n",
    "  administrator for a separate license for the toolboxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Download the latest **Osprey** code from our [Github\n",
    "  repository](https://github.com/schorschinho/osprey), then extract and add\n",
    "  the entire folder (with subfolders) to your MATLAB path. Make sure to\n",
    "  regularly check for updates, as we frequently commit new features, bug fixes,\n",
    "  and improved functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *(Optional)* To perform voxel co-registration and tissue segmentation,\n",
    "  download **SPM12** [from their\n",
    "  website](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/), then extract and\n",
    "  add to your MATLAB path.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you want to use the `Osprey` Graphical User Interface (GUI),\n",
    "  please download the following toolboxes from the MATLAB File Exchange:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - [GUI Layout\n",
    "      Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47982-gui-layout-toolbox)\n",
    "      (David Sampson)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - [Widget\n",
    "      Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/66235-widgets-toolbox)\n",
    "      (Robin Jackey)\n",
    "\n",
    "  Download both toolboxes in the MATLAB toolbox format (.mltbx). You can\n",
    "  double-click to install. MATLAB will automatically add the toolboxes to its\n",
    "  path.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure and workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "`Osprey` was designed to have easy workflow with as little user input as\n",
    "possible. It has many built-in routines to recognize data formats and sequence\n",
    "types, and will be able to perform most required processing steps automatically.\n",
    "However, some input will need to be provided by the user in the form of a *job*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A job specifies the locations of the files containing MRS and structural imaging\n",
    "data, the type of MRS sequence, and some basic control options over the data\n",
    "modeling procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a job is progressing through the `Osprey` pipeline, all raw and processed\n",
    "data associated with this job are stored in a MATLAB structure, the Osprey\n",
    "*data container*. By default, this container is called `MRSCont`, but you are free to give it a more meaningful variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Osprey`'s data handling is based in large parts on the free MATLAB toolbox FID-A. The `Osprey` folder contains a library of, sometimes modified, FID-A functions and additions. Please make sure that you do **not** include an installation of the original FID-A suite in your MATLAB path, as some functions in the `Osprey` folder might be shadowed by FID-A functions with the same name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MRSCont` data container functions as a super-structure, containing\n",
    "FID-A structures for each dataset and processing step, along with additional\n",
    "information (e.g. a few basic QA metrics, quantification results, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to organize your raw data\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw MRS data come in an overwhelming variety of formats, each producing\n",
    "different numbers of files. `Osprey` does not make a lot of assumptions with regard to your folder structure, since you specify the exact location for each file in a job file prior to each analysis. It is **highly** recommended, however, that you store different acquisitions in separate folders. Organizing your raw data in a consistent and meaningful way will save you a lot of time and nerves.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure optimal functioning of `Osprey`, we suggest adapting the folder\n",
    "hierarchy [proposed by the BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure)\n",
    "initiative](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit/wiki/The-BIDS-folder-hierarchy):\n",
    "\n",
    "> There are four main levels of the folder hierarchy, these are:\n",
    "```\n",
    "> project/\n",
    "> └── subject\n",
    ">     └── session\n",
    ">         └── acquisition\n",
    "```\n",
    "> With the exception of the top-level `project` folder, all sub-folders have a specific structure to their name (described below). Here's an example of how this hierarchy looks:\n",
    "```\n",
    "> myProject/\n",
    "> └── sub-01\n",
    ">     └── ses-01\n",
    ">         └── anat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An example adaptation of this hierarchy for Philips MRS data could look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "you define their paths in the job file accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**There is one exception: For data stored in single-average DICOM (`*.IMA`, `*.DCM`) or single-average Siemens RDA format, it is absolutely necessary to keep every scan in a separate folder.**"
