The Osprey job file is the only direct point of contact between the user and the analysis. It contains paths to MRS data files and structural images, defines processing and modelling options, and determines whether (and where) output files are being saved. The job file system ensures that all processing, modeling, and quantification steps are performed in an operator-independent, reproducible way.

You can click on the dropdown arrow on the right to take a look through the file, and then read on for a detailed description of each job file item. Example job file jobSDAT.m : %% jobSDAT.m % This function describes an Osprey job defined in a MATLAB script. % % A valid Osprey job contains four distinct classes of items: % 1. basic information on the MRS sequence used % 2. several settings for data handling and modeling % 3. a list of MRS (and, optionally, structural imaging) data files % to be loaded % 4. an output folder to store the results and exported files % % The list of MRS and structural imaging files is provided in the form of % cell arrays. They can simply be provided explicitly, or from a more % complex script that automatically determines file names from a given % folder structure. % % Osprey distinguishes between four sets of data: % - metabolite (water-suppressed) data % (MANDATORY) % Defined in cell array \"files\" % - water reference data acquired with the SAME sequence as the % metabolite data, just without water suppression RF pulses. This % data is used to determine complex coil combination % coefficients, and perform eddy current correction. % (OPTIONAL) % Defined in cell array \"files_ref\" % - additional water data used for water-scaled quantification, % usually from short-TE acquisitions due to reduced T2-weighting % (OPTIONAL) % Defined in cell array \"files_w\" % - Structural image data used for co-registration and tissue class % segmentation (usually a T1 MPRAGE). These files need to be % provided in the NIfTI format (*.nii) or, for GE data, as a % folder containing DICOM Files (*.dcm). % (OPTIONAL) % Defined in cell array \"files_nii\" % % Files in the formats % - .7 (GE) % - .SDAT, .DATA/.LIST, .RAW/.SIN/.LAB (Philips) % - .DAT (Siemens) % usually contain all of the acquired data in a single file per scan.

Sequence Information \u00b6 In this section of the job file, you determine basic information on the type of sequence you used. Sequence Type \u00b6 MANDATORY The seqType variable is a describes the sequence type, and is a required input in the form of a string. seqType determines whether the supplied datasets have been acquired with spectral editing experiments. % Specify sequence type seqType = 'unedited' ; % OPTIONS: - 'unedited' (default) % - 'MEGA' % - 'HERMES' % - 'HERCULES' Editing Targets \u00b6 MANDATORY The editTarget variable describes the sequence type, and is a required input in the form of a cell array. editTarget determines the target spin system(s) of spectral editing experiments. If no spectral editing has been performed, enter {'none'} . % Specify editing targets editTarget = { 'none' }; % OPTIONS: - {'none'} (default if 'unedited') % - {'GABA'}, {'GSH'} (for 'MEGA') % - {'GABA, 'GSH}, {'GABA, GSH, EtOH'} (for 'HERMES') % - {'HERCULES1'}, {'HERCULES2'} (for 'HERCULES') 2. Data handling and modeling options \u00b6 In this section of the job file, you provide information on whether you would like to save the processed data in externally usable file formats (for example, if you want to interface your analysis with LCModel), and specify options for the modelling. Saving data to external formats \u00b6 OPTIONAL The opts.save variable set determines whether Osprey saves the processed data in formats that can be interfaced with external analysis software. By setting opts.saveLCM to 1 , LCModel-readable .RAW files are produced. By setting opts.saveJMRUI to 1 , jMRUI/Tarquin-readable .TXT files are produced. By setting opts.saveVendor to 1 , single vendor-specific files are created, i.e. .SDAT/.SPAR files for Philips data, and .RDA files for Siemens data, regardless of the raw data format. % Save LCModel-exportable files for each spectrum? opts . saveLCM = 1 ; % OPTIONS: - 0 (no, default) % - 1 (yes) % Save jMRUI-exportable files for each spectrum? opts . saveJMRUI = 1 ; % OPTIONS: - 0 (no, default) % - 1 (yes) % Save processed spectra in vendor-specific format (SDAT/SPAR, RDA, P)? opts . saveVendor = 1 ; % OPTIONS: - 0 (no, default) % - 1 (yes) LCModel .RAW files can be loaded via the Other option in the LCModel file type selection menu. Please be aware that LCModel may prompt you to enter the number of FID data points (a positive integer number, e.g. 2048 ), dwell time (in seconds, e.g. 0.0005 ), and the static magnetic field strength in MHz (e.g. 123.26 for a Siemens 2.89 T magnet). In addition to the .RAW files, Osprey also creates the corresponding .CONTROL files. These files can be used for LCModel batch processing. for file in /storage/LCModelControlFiles/*; do /usr/local/.lcmodel/bin/lcmodel < $file; done MANDATORY To create working .CONTROL files you have to specify the following mandatory variables in the osp_lcmcontrol_params() function located in the process folder: key , FILBAS , FOLDER , and DOECC . key = 0; %Your LCM key goes here FILBAS = '/storage/myBasisSet_30ms_PRESS.BASIS'; % Location of .BASIS file used in LCModel FOLDER = '/storage/LCMoutput'; %Output folder (Create this on your linux machine first) DOECC= 'F'; % No eddy current correction in LCModel as this is already performed in Osprey. OPTIONAL The other parameters are optional and are described in the osp_lcmcontrol_params() function. When loading .TXT files with Tarquin, you will probably need to enter the echo time in seconds (e.g. 0.03 for a TE = 30 ms acquisition). The opts.saveVendor switch has been introduced to sidestep these problems with .RAW and .TXT files. LCModel, TARQUIN and jMRUI accept the .SDAT/.SPAR and .RDA file formats, and should be able to read the header information correctly. All exported third-party format files are stored in sub-directories of the output folder specified further down in the job file. Specifying fitting options \u00b6 MANDATORY The opts.fit.method variable set determines the modelling algorithm used to fit the processed spectra. Currently, the only available option is the default Osprey model. We are planning to implement other algorithms in the future. % Choose the fitting algorithm opts . fit . method = 'Osprey' ; % OPTIONS: - 'Osprey' (default) % - 'AQSES' (planned) % - 'TARQUIN' (planned) MANDATORY The opts.fit.style variable set determines how difference-edited data are modeled. By setting opts.fit.style to Concatenated , the difference and sum spectra in MEGA, HERMES and HERCULES datasets will be modeled simultaneously, i.e. with common metabolite amplitude parameters across these spectra. By setting opts.fit.style to Separate , the difference and edit-OFF spectra in MEGA, HERMES and HERCULES datasets will be modeled independently. In this case, the creatine reference signal will be determined from the edit-OFF spectrum. % Choose the fitting style for difference-edited datasets (MEGA, HERMES, HERCULES) % (only available for the Osprey fitting method) opts . fit . style = 'Concatenated' ; % OPTIONS: - 'Concatenated' (default) - will fit DIFF and SUM simultaneously) % - 'Separate' - will fit DIFF and OFF separately MANDATORY The opts.fit.range and opts.fit.rangeWater variables determine the fitting range (in ppm) of the metabolite and water spectra, respectively. % Determine fitting range (in ppm) for the metabolite and water spectra opts . fit . range = [ 0.2 4.2 ]; % [ppm] Default: [0.2 4.2] opts . fit . rangeWater = [ 2.0 7.4 ]; % [ppm] Default: [2.0 7.4] MANDATORY The opts.fit.bLineKnotSpace variable determines the spacing (in ppm) between two adjacent knots of the cubic B-spline baseline. This parameter is equivalent to the DKNTMN parameter in LCModel. Higher values correspond to a stiffer baseline, while lower values will produce a larger number of spline knots, allowing for greater flexibility of the baseline. % Determine the baseline knot spacing (in ppm) for the metabolite spectra opts . fit . bLineKnotSpace = 0.4 ; % [ppm] Default: 0.4. Choosing lower values for the bLineKnotSpace variable will improve the fit quality at the expense of overparametrization of the model. LCModel uses a default knot spacing of DKNTMN = 0.15 , i.e. 0.15 ppm, which likely allows too much flexibility. In the absence of baseline regularization in the current stage of the Osprey model development, we chose to restrict baseline flexibility by opting for a default value of 0.4 ppm. MANDATORY The opts.fit.fitMM variable determines whether simulated Gaussian signals representing broad macromolecular and lipid signals are included in the basis set. By default, Osprey includes these basis functions. If you want to use an experimentally measured MM/lipid basis function, or operate at long echo times where the MM and lipid resonances have decayed, you can set opts.fit.fitMM = 0 to exclude them. % Add macromolecule and lipid basis functions to the fit? opts . fit . fitMM = 1 ; % OPTIONS: - 0 (no) % - 1 (yes, default) 3. Specifying MRS data and structural imaging files \u00b6 In this section of the job file, you specify the full paths to the MRS data and structural imaging files that you would like to process and analyze. Osprey is designed for the batch analysis of multiple datasets in one session. Each dataset corresponds to an element of a cell array. The cell arrays for metabolite data, water reference data, short-TE water data, and structural imaging files need to have the same number of elements. For example, if you have MRS data from two voxels in the same subject, you need to enter the path to the .NII structural twice into the files_nii cell array. At the current stage of implementation, you can only analyze one type of sequence per job file, i.e. if you have MEGA-PRESS and PRESS data for each subject, you will have to design two separate job files for MEGA-PRESS and PRESS data. Metabolite data \u00b6 MANDATORY The files variable is defined as a cell array of full paths to the raw MRS data files containing your metabolite (water-suppressed) data. % Specify metabolite data % (MANDATORY) files = { which ( 'exampledata/sdat/sub-01/mrs/sub-01_press/sub-01_PRESS_35_act.sdat' ), ... which ( 'exampledata/sdat/sub-02/mrs/sub-02_press/sub-02_PRESS_35_act.sdat' )}; In the job files in the exampledata folder of the Osprey repository, the which function ensures that the paths are correctly defined regardless of where you put your Osprey folder. When designing your own job file, you will have to provide the full paths to your raw data, e.g.: % Specify metabolite data % (MANDATORY) files = { '/Users/Georg/Documents/MRSData/study-01/sub-01/mrs/sub-01_press/sub-01_PRESS_35_act.sdat' , ... '/Users/Georg/Documents/MRSData/study-01/sub-02/mrs/sub-02_press/sub-02_PRESS_35_act.sdat' ,}; Instead of writing out the full paths explicitly, you can also create a procedure that is tailored to your local file organization, as long as you end up with a files cell array containing an element for each file you want to analyze. Single-average DICOM and Siemens RDA datasets MRS raw data can be exported in DICOM and Siemens RDA format, where each average is saved as a separate .DCM or .RDA file. In this case, you have to enter the full path to the folder containing all single-average files belong to one acquisition . Please refer to the data organization chapter of this documentation for best practices on creating a useful folder structure for your raw data. Lineshape reference data \u00b6 OPTIONAL The files_ref variable is defined as a cell array of full paths to the raw MRS data files to your lineshape (water-unsuppressed) reference data. These are an optional input, acquired with the same sequence as the metabolite data, but without water suppression, and used to perform eddy-current correction of the metabolite data. % Specify water reference data for eddy-current correction (same sequence as metabolite data!) % (OPTIONAL) % Leave empty for GE P-files (.7) - these include water reference data by % default. files_ref = { which ( 'exampledata/sdat/sub-01/mrs/sub-01_press-ref/sub-01_PRESS_35_ref.sdat' ), ... which ( 'exampledata/sdat/sub-02/mrs/sub-02_press-ref/sub-02_PRESS_35_ref.sdat' )}; If only lineshape reference data are provided, this signal is also used to calculate water-scaled concentration estimates. Short-TE water data \u00b6 OPTIONAL The files_w variable is defined as a cell array of full paths to the raw MRS data files to short-TE water data. These are another optional input, and can be used to derive water-scaled concentration estimates (while lineshape reference data are only used for eddy-current correction). Using short-TE water as the concentration reference standard reduces T2-weighting of the water reference signal (and associated correction errors) compared to long-TE water data. % Specify water data for quantification (e.g. short-TE water scan) % (OPTIONAL) files_w = { which ( 'exampledata/sdat/sub-01/mrs/sub-01_press-ref/sub-01_PRESS_35_ref.sdat' ), ... which ( 'exampledata/sdat/sub-02/mrs/sub-02_press-ref/sub-02_PRESS_35_ref.sdat' )}; Structural images \u00b6 OPTIONAL The files_nii variable is defined as a cell array of full paths to T1-weighted structural images used for co-registration and segmentation purposes. Osprey requires NIfTI ( .nii ) files to be supplied. For GE files, you may also provide the full path to a directory containing the DICOM folders corresponding to the T1 acquisition. % Specify T1-weighted structural imaging data % (OPTIONAL) % Link to single NIfTI (.nii) files for Siemens and Philips data % Link to DICOM (.dcm) folders for GE data files_nii = { which ( 'exampledata/sdat/sub-01/anat/sub-01_T1w.nii' ), ... which ( 'exampledata/sdat/sub-02/anat/sub-02_T1w.nii' )}; Osprey uses SPM12 functions to load and process structural images. Please refer to the installation instructions for information on how to set up SPM12. 4. Specifying the output folder \u00b6 In this section of the job file, you specify the full paths to an output folder where the Osprey data container is saved in .mat format. In addition, any exported files (for use with jMRUI, TARQUIN, or LCModel) will be saved in separate sub-folders of the output folder. MANDATORY The outputFolder variable specifies a full path to the output folder. If the output folder does not exist yet, it will be created. % Specify output folder % (MANDATORY) outputFolder = strrep ( which ( 'exampledata/sdat/jobSDAT.m' ), 'jobSDAT.m' , 'derivatives' ); In the job files in the example folder of the Osprey repository, the which and strrep functions ensures that an output folder derivatives in the folder where the job file jobSDAT resides. When designing your own job file, you will have to provide the full path to your desired output folder. Note that Osprey detects if the output folder already exists and contains data from a previous analysis. In this case, you will be prompted whether you would like to overwrite the existing output.","title":"Job files"},{"location":"03-job-files/01-the-job-file/#the-osprey-job-file","text":"Every Osprey analysis requires the user to provide a job file.

Choosing lower values for the bLineKnotSpace variable will improve the fit quality at the expense of overparametrization of the model. LCModel uses a default knot spacing of DKNTMN = 0.15 , i.e. 0.15 ppm, which likely allows too much flexibility. In the absence of baseline regularization in the current stage of the Osprey model development, we chose to restrict baseline flexibility by opting for a default value of 0.4 ppm. MANDATORY The opts.fit.fitMM variable determines whether simulated Gaussian signals representing broad macromolecular and lipid signals are included in the basis set. By default, Osprey includes these basis functions.

We will learn how to start the GUI, select the job file, load the raw data, process them into spectra, model the processed spectra, co-register the voxel to anatomical images, segment the anatomical images, and derive quantitative metabolite estimates. Info In this documentation chapter, we will use the jobTwix.m job file in the exampledata/twix/ directory of the Osprey repository . 1. Starting Osprey \u00b6 At the MATLAB prompt, enter >> Osprey This will initiate the Osprey GUI application and the underlying processing modules. Once the startup is complete, you will see the Osprey startup menu box: 2. Loading a job file \u00b6 Click the Load Job file button, navigate to the exampledata/twix directory, and add the file jobTwix.m to the right column: Click Done . If you have run an Osprey analysis previously with the same output folder specified in the job file, you will be shown a warning: Click Yes . Osprey will now extract all necessary information from the job file you selected by running the OspreyJob module in the background. The next window you see is the main GUI: In the bottom left corner, you see a list of datasets included in the job file definition. Info All tabs and buttons (except Load Data , Save MRSCont , and Exit ) are greyed out at this stage. They will become gradually available as we progress through the analysis workflow. 3. Loading the raw MRS data \u00b6 Click the Load data button to initiate the loading process of the raw MRS data. Osprey will now extract the raw FIDs and header data (and perform coil combination, if applicable) by running the OspreyLoad module in the background. For larger files (with separate FIDs for each coil), this process may take a few seconds per dataset. You can monitor the progress through the wait bar. Once the loading process is complete, you can see the coil-combined, but un-aligned and un-averaged data. You can select the dataset you wish to be displayed by clicking on the entry in the dataset list in the bottom left corner, and you can easily scroll through the different datasets using the \u2b06 and \u2b07 keys on your keyboard. First dataset Second dataset By clicking the metabolites , reference and water tabs at the bottom of the window, you can display the water-suppressed, lineshape reference, and short-TE water data (if applicable): Metabolite data Lineshape reference data Short-TE water data Info In the box above the spectrum display, you will find useful information about the sequence, such as TR/TE, number of averages, voxel dimensions, etc. Info You can export a PDF of the spectrum (along with the information box) by clicking on the Save PDF button in the top right corner of the window. 3. Processing the raw data \u00b6 Click the (now available!) Process data button to initiate the post-processing. Osprey will now perform all appropriate processing steps (depending on the available data: eddy-current correction, frequency-and-phase alignment, water removal, frequency referencing, initial phasing) by running the OspreyProcess module in the background. This process may take several seconds per dataset. You can monitor the progress through the wait bar. Once the post-processing is complete, the Processed tab becomes active, showing four different panels: The top left panel shows the individual averages prior to frequency-and-phase alignment. The bottom left panel shows them after frequency-and-phase alignment. The top right panel shows a scatter plot of the maximum of the 3.02 ppm Cr/PCr signal over the course of the acquisition for both pre- and post-alignment. Finally, the bottom right panel shows the aligned, averaged and referenced spectrum after eddy-current correction and residual water removal. This spectrum will be passed on to the Fit module for modelling. Info You can go back to inspecting the raw data by clicking the Raw tab at the top of the window. Again, you can display each dataset by selecting it from the dataset list in the bottom left corner, and you can look at the water reference data by clicking on the tabs at the bottom of the window. Info In the box above the spectrum display, you will find some data quality metrics, such as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), linewidth (FWHM), and average frequency drift pre- and post-alignment. Info You can export a PDF of the four post-processing display panels (along with the information box) by clicking on the Save PDF button in the top right corner of the window. 4. Fitting the spectra \u00b6 Click the (now available!) Fit data button to initiate the post-processing. Osprey will now model the processed metabolite and water spectra by running the OspreyFit module in the background. This process may take from a few seconds up to a minute or more per dataset, depending on the complexity of the model. You can monitor the progress through the wait bar. Once the modelling is complete, the Fit tab becomes active: The Fit tab displays the complete fit overlaid on top of the data, along with the smooth cubic B-spline baseline, and the fit residual at the top. Below, the contributions from each basis functions are plotted, with the estimated lineshape convolution, linebroadening and frequency shift parameters applied. For better display, the phase parameters have been applied to the spectrum, so that the basis functions appear without phase. The left panel shows the raw water-scaled metabolite estimates, i.e. the signal amplitudes normalized by the water amplitude. The amplitude parameters will subsequently be used during the quantification process to derive tCr ratios and water-scaled estimates. Info You can go back to the previous analysis steps by clicking the Raw or Processed tabs at the top of the window. Again, you can display each dataset by selecting it from the dataset list in the bottom left corner, and you can look at the water reference data fits by clicking on the tabs at the bottom of the window. Info In the box above the spectrum display, you will find fit parameters and information, such as the number of basis functions used, phase estimates, and scaling factors. Info You can export a PDF of the fit (along with the information box) by clicking on the Save PDF button in the top right corner of the window. 5. Co-registering to an anatomical image \u00b6 Click the CoRegister button to initiate the SPM routines for co-registering a voxel to a T1-weighted anatomical image. Osprey will now parse the voxel geometry information and create the voxel mask by running the OspreyCoReg module in the background. This process will take a few seconds per dataset. You can monitor the progress through the wait bar. Info If you are only interested in the voxel mask, you can skip the Process and Fit steps of the analysis. The CoRegister button becomes available after the Load data analysis step has been completed. Once the co-registration is complete, the Cor/Seg tab becomes active: You can see an overlay of the voxel mask on top of the anatomical image in three directions. Info You can export a PDF of the co-registration display by clicking on the Save PDF button in the top right corner of the window. 6. Segmentation and tissue fraction calculation \u00b6 Click the Segment button to initiate the determination of the tissue volume fractions for the co-registered voxel. Osprey will now call the SPM12 segmentation functions and calculate the fractions of grey matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid by running the OspreySeg module in the background. If you have previously segmented the images, this step will only take a few seconds. However, if Osprey has to initiate the segmentation first, it can take up to several minutes per dataset. You can monitor the progress through the wait bar. Info If you are only interested in the tissue fractions, you can skip the Process and Fit steps of the analysis. The Segment button becomes available after the Load data and CoRegister analysis steps have been completed. Once the segmentation is complete, the Cor/Seg tab features another figure: Below the overlay produced by CoRegister , you can now see four images showing the voxel mask next to the contributions from grey matter, white matter, and CSF, along with the fractional volume estimates for each tissue class. These values will subsequently be used during quantification to account for tissue-specific effects of relaxation, tissue water content, and metabolite content. Info You can export a PDF of the combined co-registration/segmentation display by clicking on the Save PDF button in the top right corner of the window. 7. Quantification \u00b6 Click the Quantify button to have Osprey run the OspreyQuantify module in the background. This should take less than a second per dataset. During this process, several quantitative metabolite estimates are calculated, such as tCr ratios and water-scaled estimates with different degrees of sophistication. Please refer to the Osprey manuscript for details on the implementation of these quantification routines. Once the quantification is complete, the Quantify tab becomes active: This tab contains a bare-bone table of the quantitative results for each basis function and each quantification routine for the selected dataset. These numbers are saved in .CSV format tables in the QuantifyResults sub-directory of the output folder. At this stage, all analysis steps have been completed. You can save the current state of the analysis by exporting it the Osprey data container as a .mat file using the Save MRSCont button. You can re-load it at any time using the Load MRSCont file button in the Osprey startup menu (see Step 1 of this tutorial). 8. Overview \u00b6 After quantification is complete, another tab becomes active: Overview . This tab contains several visualizations that are interesting for the batched analysis of multiple datasets. By clicking on the tabs at the bottom of the window, you can cycle through the following visualizations: Spectra : Displays all processed spectra (or fits) on top of each other in a single plot. Info You can select the data or complete fits for the metabolite and water data by using the dropdown menu at the top of the window. Mean spectra : Displays the mean of spectra (or fits) across all datasets, along with the mean baseline, mean residual, and a ribbon plot representing the standard deviation across all spectra. Info You can select the metabolite and water data by using the dropdown menu at the top of the window. Mean spectra : Displays the mean of spectra (or fits) across all datasets, along with the mean baseline, mean residual, and a ribbon plot representing the standard deviation across all spectra. Info You can select the metabolite and water data by using the dropdown menu at the top of the window. Quantify table : Shows a table with the results of a specific quantification routine for all metabolites and all datasets. Info You can select the quantification routine to be displayed (tCr ratios, raw water-scaled, CSF-corrected water-scaled, tissue-corrected water-scaled) by using the dropdown menu at the top of the window. Distribution : Shows a raincloud plot of the results of a specific quantification routine for a specific metabolite. The raincloud plot includes a visualization of the distribution, the mean and median values of the distribution, standard deviation, and 25% and 75% percentiles. In addition, each data point is shown. Info You can select the quantification routine to be displayed (tCr ratios, raw water-scaled, CSF-corrected water-scaled, tissue-corrected water-scaled), as well as the particular metabolite you want to study. By default, the Distribution tab is set to display the tCr ratios of tNAA. Correlation : Shows a highly customizable 2D scatter plot of a quantitative metabolite estimate against another quantitative metabolite estimate, or a quality metric. Osprey automatically calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient and a p-value (uncorrected for multiple comparisons), and plots the linear regression line with shaded confidence intervals. Info You can select the quantification routine and metabolite to be correlated, as well as another metabolite or quality metric that it is to be correlated against, by using the dropdown menus at the top of the window. By default, the Correlation tab is set to display the correlation of tNAA/tCr to SNR.

By default, the Distribution tab is set to display the tCr ratios of tNAA. Correlation : Shows a highly customizable 2D scatter plot of a quantitative metabolite estimate against another quantitative metabolite estimate, or a quality metric. Osprey automatically calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient and a p-value (uncorrected for multiple comparisons), and plots the linear regression line with shaded confidence intervals. Info You can select the quantification routine and metabolite to be correlated, as well as another metabolite or quality metric that it is to be correlated against, by using the dropdown menus at the top of the window. By default, the Correlation tab is set to display the correlation of tNAA/tCr to SNR.

These are collections of model spectra ( basis functions ) for the various metabolites you wish to quantify. Historically, basis functions were acquired experimentally from aqueous solutions, which was a laborious and often incredibly frustrating task. Fortunately, many free software solutions open up a world of simulating any NMR experiment, and can generate noise-free model spectra of most of the spin systems we could be interested in. In this chapter, you will learn how to generate an Osprey basis set. You can either import an existing complete basis set in LCModel format ( .BASIS ), or you can compile an Osprey basis set from a set of synthetic spectra that have been simulated using the FID-A software . Please refer to the example scripts in the repository for directions and how to do this. You can also ask for advice in the Spectral Simulation and Basis Sets categories of the MRSHub forum . io_LCMBasis \u00b6 If you have an existing LCModel basis set ( .BASIS ), you can import it into Osprey . Assuming the basis set is located at /Users/Georg/LCModelBasissets/GE/press144 , you can execute the following command at the MATLAB prompt after you have run OspreyJob : >> file = '/Users/Georg/LCModelBasissets/GE/press144' ; You can then call Osprey 's io_LCMBasis function to create a basis set: >> [ BASIS ] = io_LCMBasis ( file , 1 , 'unedited' , 'none' ); Follow the instructions in the MATLAB prompt, and from then on, OspreyFit will automatically pick this basis set, but only if there is no internal existing Osprey basis set with matching parameters. We will soon provide the option to specify an individual basis set in the job file. fit_makeBasis \u00b6 For the purpose of this tutorial, we will assume that you have a set of FID-A simulations saved in a folder on your hard drive. Your folder may look like this: In this case, we have simulated a bunch of metabolites for the GE PRESS sequence at an echo time of 144 ms. If this folder is located at, say, /Users/Georg/MRS_Simulations/GE/press144 , you can create a variable called folder at the MATLAB prompt: >> folder = '/Users/Georg/MRS_Simulations/GE/press144' ; You can then call Osprey 's fit_makeBasis function to create a basis set: >> [ BASIS ] = fit_makeBasis ( folder , 1 , 'unedited' ); This will generate a struct array called BASIS in the MATLAB workspace, and also save it to the current MATLAB working directory. This file is your new Osprey basis set.
