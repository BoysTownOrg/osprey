# LCGannet

LCGannet is an all-in-one software suite for state-of-the art processing and
quantitative analysis of in-vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

LCGannet requires [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and
has been tested on version 2017a and newer. The following toolboxes are
required:

- Image processing
- Optimization
- Signal Processing
- Statistics and Machine Learning
- Wavelet

### Installation

Download the latest **LCGannet** code from its [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/schorschinho/LCGannet), then extract and add the
entire folder (with subfolders) to your MATLAB path. Make sure to regularly
check for updates, as we frequently commit new features, bug fixes, and improved
functions.

To perform voxel co-registration and tissue segmentation, download **SPM12**
[from the UCL website](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/), then
extract and add to your MATLAB path.
